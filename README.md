# Coding Assassins

###The Project###
This project is quite easy to understand, in essence the app is a project managment system.
The app has two sides to it, the Client side and the Developer(Assassin) side. 

##Client##
The client is able to create requests for job's that will be done, and after look through a list of developers to
choose whom they wish to hire for their job. After the jonb is done the client will recieve an email notification.

##Developer##
On the developer end each developer has the ability to access a webportal where they are able to check what jobs
they've been hired to complete. Each developer has their own portal which the have to log in to via a password and name.
